# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a biohackathon project repository (KIDS24-team7) from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital BioHackathon. The repository is currently in its initial state with only basic documentation and licensing.

## Current State

The repository contains:
- `README.md` - Minimal project identification
- `LICENSE` - MIT License from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital BioHackathon
- Basic git repository structure

## Development Setup

Since this is an early-stage repository without defined technology stack or build system, development commands will depend on the technologies chosen by the team. Common bioinformatics and data science stacks might include:

- Python with conda/pip environments
- R with renv or packrat
- Jupyter notebooks
- Docker containers
- Web applications (React/Node.js, Flask/Django)

## Architecture Notes

Architecture and structure information will be added as the project develops and code is committed to the repository.

## Repository Context

- **Organization**: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital BioHackathon
- **Team**: Team 7
- **Event**: KIDS24 Biohackathon
- **License**: MIT License
- **Remote**: git@github.com:stjude-biohackathon/KIDS24-team7.git

## Future Development

When code is added to this repository, this file should be updated to include:
- Build and test commands specific to the chosen technology stack
- Project architecture and component relationships
- Development workflow and contribution guidelines
- Any bioinformatics-specific tools or data processing pipelines
